		About wGUI v0.4 BETA:
			
	- Removed the mandatory advertisement CALLBACK function - wndProc, it is declared with class
    	- Now, thanks wGUI, you can create a separate application form with only 8 lines. (!)
     	- Unfortunately, to give a user access to another function does not work (-) as when announcements with gooey element in another function arises program crash
        	in the event handler. Almost 1 hour thinking how to fix crash, ideas are not (!)
    	- Most likely today will integrate TButton class and one class under TCheckBox TButtonEx. In the designer will be able to select a checkbox or just buttons

UPD:
    - TCheckBox TButton and are united in one class - TButton. Defect has been corrected.
    - Appending the couple "makrosnyh" or whatever they are called conditions
    - For the same reason that TButton TCheckBox and I think that we need to move TMemo and TEdit under one class - TEdit
